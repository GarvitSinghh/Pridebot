## Getting started
make sure to spread propaganda about pride bot I MEAN TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU'RE CHANGING!!

# WHAT CAN YOU DO

## telling blahaj what to do next

you could [Open an issue](https://github.com/tyffical/Pridebot/issues/new) but that's very formal

## Contributing words

write words. blahaj probably won't read it though

## Contributing magic

we have friendos hwo can do it for u if u don't know what to do

BLAHAJ BELIEVES YOU CAN DO IT!!

1. use a fork (or a spork to be a milennial) to make ur own copy of this
2. use the power of blahaj to get it on your own computer
3. start coding!!
4. finish coding!!
5. test the coding!! bugs? good luck!
6. send ur code back to the internetwebs and then hope blahaj likes it

## [Contributing Docs / Code] Open a Pull Request

make a pull request ting 

make sure the name of it will tell us what it does otherwise we might cry

ask for help in discord if you can't figure it out

if we like it we will stick it into the bot and hopefully bot [works ahead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AYv6rV3NXE) (uh yeah, i sure hope it does)
### BINGO IT'S DONE

you get to appear on a fancy [chart](https://github.com/tyffical/Pridebot/graphs/contributors) and become a greater part of the squad

BLAHAJ STILL LOVES YOU EVEN IF IT DOESN'T WORK
